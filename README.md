# DogBarberShop

I developed a dog barbershop management that allows the customer to manage his orders.
The system includes authentication - Register, Login, Logout etc.

When the customer is logged in ,he will see his all orders.
The customer can also add new orders, delete order, and update existing order.

Technologies: React.js, Redux , Asp.net Core, SQL Server.
